### 1. **Frontend-Only Application (SPA - Single-Page Application)**

A **frontend-only** application is typically built with frameworks like React, Vue.js, or Angular. It handles everything on the client-side, and communicates with a backend via APIs.

```

├── public/                     # Public static files (HTML, images, etc.)
│   ├── index.html              # The main HTML template
│   ├── favicon.ico             # Favicon for the website
│   └── assets/                 # Static assets (logos, icons, images)
│
├── src/                        # Main source code for the frontend
│   ├── components/             # Reusable UI components (buttons, headers)
│   │   ├── Button.js           # Example of a custom button component
│   │   └── MenuCard.js         # Component for displaying a menu item
│   ├── pages/                  # Pages (views) corresponding to routes
│   │   ├── HomePage.js         # Home page with the restaurant list
│   │   ├── OrderPage.js        # Order details page
│   │   └── LoginPage.js        # User login page
│   ├── services/               # Handles API calls to the backend
│   │   └── api.js              # API request functions for interacting with backend
│   ├── utils/                  # Utility functions (formatting, helpers)
│   ├── App.js                  # Root component, sets up routing, and structure
│   └── index.js                # Entry point for React or other frameworks
│
├── tests/                      # Unit and integration tests
│   ├── components/             # Tests for UI components (Button, MenuCard)
│   └── pages/                  # Tests for page components (HomePage, OrderPage)
│
├── .gitignore                  # Git ignore file (to exclude node_modules, logs, etc.)
├── package.json                # Defines frontend dependencies, scripts (build, test)
├── README.md                   # Project documentation file
└── LICENSE                     # License for the project (e.g., MIT)
```

### Key Points:
- **components/**: Contains reusable UI components (buttons, modals, etc.).
- **pages/**: The main views that correspond to the routes in your app (Home, Login, Order).
- **services/**: API functions that interact with the backend.
- **tests/**: Unit and integration tests to ensure the frontend is working as expected.

### 2. **Backend-Only Application (API Service)**

This structure is used when you're building just the backend of your application, usually providing an API that your frontend can interact with. Common backend technologies include Node.js, Express, Python with Flask/Django, etc.

```
food-delivery-api/
│
├── controllers/                # Logic for handling API requests
│   ├── authController.js       # Logic for authentication (login, register)
│   ├── orderController.js      # Logic for order management (create, update)
│   └── menuController.js       # Logic for menu management (add, update, delete)
│
├── models/                     # Database models (representing tables/entities)
│   ├── userModel.js            # User model (for customers and restaurant owners)
│   ├── orderModel.js           # Order model (for food orders)
│   └── menuModel.js            # Menu model (for food items)
│
├── routes/                     # API routes (define the endpoints for the app)
│   ├── authRoutes.js           # Routes related to authentication (login, register)
│   ├── orderRoutes.js          # Routes for order management
│   └── menuRoutes.js           # Routes for managing menu items
│
├── config/                     # Configuration files for DB and environment variables
│   ├── dbConfig.js             # Database connection setup
│   └── config.js               # Application-wide configuration (e.g., JWT secret)
│
├── middlewares/                # Custom middleware (e.g., authentication check)
│   └── authMiddleware.js       # Middleware to verify JWT for protected routes
│
├── db/                         # Database migrations, schema, and seed files
│   └── schema.sql              # SQL file to set up database schema
│
├── tests/                      # Unit and integration tests for backend logic
│   ├── authTest.js             # Tests for authentication-related features
│   ├── orderTest.js            # Tests for order-related features
│   └── menuTest.js             # Tests for menu-related features
│
├── .env                        # Environment variables (e.g., DB credentials)
├── .gitignore                  # Git ignore for node_modules, logs, etc.
├── server.js                   # Main entry point for the backend server
├── package.json                # Lists backend dependencies (Node.js)
└── README.md                   # Project documentation file
```

### Key Points:
- **controllers/**: Contains logic that handles API requests and interacts with the models.
- **models/**: Represents the database tables/entities like Users, Orders, and Menu items.
- **routes/**: Define API routes/endpoints for user authentication, orders, and menus.
- **middlewares/**: Custom middleware for authentication checks or data validation.
- **tests/**: Unit and integration tests for API routes and backend logic.

### 3. **Monolithic Application (Backend + Frontend Together)**

In a **monolithic** architecture, both the frontend and backend reside within the same project. This is common for smaller applications or MVPs where the app is simple and the scale is manageable.

```
food-delivery-app/
│
├── client/                     # Frontend (React, Vue.js, or other JS frameworks)
│   ├── public/                 # Public static files
│   ├── src/                    # Source code for the frontend
│   ├── package.json            # Frontend dependencies
│   └── .gitignore              # Frontend-specific gitignore
│
├── server/                     # Backend (Node.js, Express, Django, etc.)
│   ├── controllers/            # API route controllers
│   ├── models/                 # Database models
│   ├── routes/                 # API route definitions
│   ├── app.js                  # Main backend file
│   └── .gitignore              # Backend-specific gitignore
│
├── db/                         # Database setup and schema
│   └── schema.sql              # SQL schema for database
│
├── tests/                      # Unit and integration tests
│   ├── client/                 # Frontend tests
│   └── server/                 # Backend tests
│
├── .env                        # Environment variables for both client and server
├── .gitignore                  # Global ignore file
├── package.json                # Root file managing both frontend and backend dependencies
├── README.md                   # Documentation for the whole app
└── LICENSE                     # License for the project
```

### Key Points:
- **Unified Structure**: Frontend and backend reside in the same codebase, simplifying management for small applications.
- **Shared Database**: Backend and frontend work together with a single shared database schema.
- **Tests**: Separate test folders for frontend and backend components.

### 4. **Microservices Architecture (Backend Service Decomposition)**

For more complex applications with scaling requirements, a **microservices architecture** breaks the application into smaller, independent services. Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

```
food-delivery-microservices/
│
├── auth-service/                # Authentication service
│   ├── controllers/             # Handles user login, register logic
│   ├── models/                  # User data model
│   └── app.js                   # Main entry for auth service
│
├── menu-service/                # Menu management service
│   ├── controllers/             # Handles menu item creation, updates
│   ├── models/                  # Menu item data model
│   └── app.js                   # Main entry for menu service
│
├── order-service/               # Order management service
│   ├── controllers/             # Handles order placement, updates, and tracking
│   ├── models/                  # Order data model
│   └── app.js                   # Main entry for order service
│
├── api-gateway/                 # API Gateway that routes requests to individual services
│   ├── controllers/             # API Gateway routing logic
│   └── app.js                   # API Gateway main file
│
├── docker/                      # Docker-related files for microservice deployment
│   ├── docker-compose.yml       # Docker compose file for local development
│   └── Dockerfile               # Service-specific Dockerfiles
│
├── .env                         # Environment variables for each service
├── .gitignore                   # Git ignore for service-specific files
├── README.md                    # Documentation for each service
└── LICENSE                      # License for the project
```

### Key Points:
- **Microservices**: Each core functionality (Auth, Menu, Order) is broken into independent services.
- **API Gateway**: A single entry point for routing requests to appropriate services.
- **Docker**: Docker used for containerization, making deployment easier.

---

### Conclusion

Each of these project structures serves a different purpose, depending on the scale of your application and the desired architecture. Here's a quick recap:

- **Frontend-Only Application**: Great for Single-Page Applications (SPA) where the backend is handled by APIs.
- **Backend-Only Application**: Focuses on handling API requests, useful when you have a separate frontend.
- **Monolithic Application**: A combined approach for small-to-medium scale projects where both frontend and backend are managed together.
- **Microservices Architecture**: A more scalable, distributed approach where functionality is split into smaller services that communicate via APIs.
